Cassandra Database Project - Cloud Deployment & AI Ops

Project Overview

This project involves working with a Cassandra database hosted on Astra. The solution will be deployed on a cloud platform (AWS, Azure, or GCP) with an API or user interface for model testing. Logging will be implemented using Python's logging library. Additionally, an AI Ops pipeline will be integrated using tools like DVC, MLflow, or Sagemaker. The project will require proper documentation, including HLD, LLD, system architecture, and wireframe designs.

Features

Setup Instructions

Database Setup:

Sign up on Astra

Create a Cassandra database instance

Connect to the database using provided credentials

Cloud Setup:

Choose a cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP)

Set up a VM or container service (EC2, GKE, AKS, etc.)

API/UI Implementation:

If using an API, create a Flask or FastAPI backend

If creating a UI, use React, Vue, or Angular

Logging Implementation:

Use Python's logging module to track all actions

AI Ops Pipeline Integration:

Set up DVC for data versioning

Use MLflow for model tracking

Deploy models using Sagemaker, Azure ML, or another tool

Deployment Strategy:

Choose cloud, edge, or local deployment

Justify the selection in the architecture document

Documentation

HLD (High-Level Design): Overview of system components and interactions

LLD (Low-Level Design): Detailed implementation of components

System Architecture: Cloud architecture and data flow

Wireframe: UI or API structure and endpoints
